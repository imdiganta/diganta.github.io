It then sets the `registration_date` field to the current UTC date using the `frappe.utcnow()` method.\nYou can use this model to create a registration table in your database by running the following code:\n```\nregistration = UserRegistration(\"John Doe\", \"john.doe@example.com\")\nregistration.save(commit=True)\n```\nThis code will create a new row in the registration table with the `name` and `email` fields set to \"John Doe\" and \"john.doe@example.com\" respectively. The `save()` method will save the object to the database.\nI hope this helps!
