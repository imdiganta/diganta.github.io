As a conductor heats up, its resistance decreases, and as it cools down, its resistance increases. This is because the atoms in the conductor become more widely spaced as they heat up, causing them to conduct electricity less well.\n\nPoint 2: Types of Resistance\n\nThere are two main types of resistance: \n\n* Ohmic resistance: This is the resistance that occurs in a conductor due to the flow of current. It is measured in ohms and depends on the material of the conductor, as well as the temperature and length of the conductor.\n* Frictional resistance: This is the resistance that occurs when a charged particle is moved through a conductor. It is measured in volts and depends on the material of the conductor and the speed at which the charged particle is moving.\n\nI hope this helps!
